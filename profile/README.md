## ZIGEN is a windowing system for XR

In the modern desktop environment, windowing systems such as X11 or Wayland
provide a multitasking environment where multi applications from different
developers work together.

However, in today’s immersive environment, a single main application occupies
the user’s entire field of view. This limitation was not fatal as long as the
primary use of XR was things like gaming which created a unified world.

But now, the use of XR is becoming more diverse, and this limitation can no
longer be ignored, especially when XR is used as a work environment.

We need an XR work environment where users can
- install and use multiple applications from different developers together.
  - Each application is like an object that occupies only a part of the user's view.
  - Data transferring such as "drag and drop" between applications is supported.
- develop an application they want, and use it together with other applications.

ZIGEN makes these things happen!
